a.)
My Data set
```{r}
data_set <- read.csv("C:/Users/rache/Documents/STAT 3010/Hw1_Q14_data.csv", header = T)
```
Stem Plot
```{r}
stem(data_set$shower_flow_rate)
```

capture.output(stem(data_set$score))
file <- "C:/Users/rache/Documents/STAT 3010/Ex.1.2_Q14_data.txt"

b.)
Typical flow rate is the flow rate that appears the most. So we would take one of the values from 6. ex = 6.7

c.)
Highly concentrated, only one outlier. 

d.)
distribution is left skewed since there are more values below the typical flow rate.

e.)
Outlier would be 18.9.
